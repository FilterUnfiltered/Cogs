# Cogs - Rust in HTML

Cogs is a fullstack framework for building HATEOAS-based web applications using a custom templating language that compiles directly to highly-optimized Rust code.

[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) is recommended alongside Cogs as the frontend piece of the HATEOAS stack.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic syntax and parsing
- [ ] Code generation
- [ ] (?) Custom codegen based HTMX alternative
- [ ] (?) WASM-based "Client Components"
